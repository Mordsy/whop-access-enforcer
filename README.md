This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Webhook Testing

### Local Testing with curl

To test the webhook endpoint locally, ensure your dev server is running and you have `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` set in your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Test with a sample membership.went_invalid event
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/whop/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "evt_test_123",
    "type": "membership.went_invalid",
    "data": {
      "id": "mem_abc123",
      "company_id": "biz_test001",
      "user_id": "user_xyz789",
      "product_id": "prod_def456",
      "status": "canceled"
    }
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{"received":true,"webhook_id":"evt_test_123","event_type":"membership.went_invalid"}
```

### Verifying in Dashboard

After sending a test webhook, the event should appear in the Audit Log section of the dashboard at `/dashboard/biz_test001`.

### Idempotency Test

Sending the same webhook twice should return:
```json
{"received":true,"duplicate":true,"webhook_id":"evt_test_123"}
```

### Required Environment Variables

For webhook processing:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key (server-only, never expose to client)
